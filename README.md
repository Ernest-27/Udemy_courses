UDEMY COURSES.
Looking at this dataset, different questions came to mind to aid in the analysis and provide in-depth insights. 
Below are the various critical questions that were asked in order to carefully analyze this dataset.
•	What is the total number of subscribers in a particular subject? What is the most popular subject based on the number of subscribers?
•	Among the subscribers for each subject, what are the numbers of students that took the free courses and the paid ones?
•	What is the cumulative cost/price of the courses in each subject?
•	What is the correlation between the prices and the total number of reviews?
•	What is the correlation between the prices and the total number of subscribers?
•	What is the most popular level among the subscribers?
•	Are there free courses? What is the level of subscription in those courses compared to the paid ones?
•	Is there a correlation between the number of lectures in a course and the reviews?
•	What are the number of free and paid courses in a particular subject?
I would be making use of Python to analyze this dataset and create charts to further illustrate the insights gotten.
